# Rust Default Backend for CMS

Rust Default Backend provides a foundational structure for content management systems (CMS). This project includes default sections for various types of CMS, such as Coffee Management Systems or Restaurant Management Systems.

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a foundation for developing CMS management systems. With the Rms CLI tool, you can quickly generate default backend systems, enabling you to rapidly set up the starting code structure for any type of management system.
